# EULA Comparison Platform

A comprehensive platform for comparing End User License Agreements and Terms of Service across major companies to promote consumer awareness and fair competition.

## Project Overview
This platform scrapes, analyzes, and compares EULAs/ToS from major companies, highlighting problematic terms and suggesting consumer-friendly alternatives.

## Architecture
- **Backend**: Python Flask/FastAPI
- **Frontend**: React/Vue.js
- **Database**: PostgreSQL
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Search**: Elasticsearch
- **Deployment**: Docker containers on Linux ARM

## Development Sessions
This project is designed for modular development across multiple LLM sessions:
1. Database & Models
2. Web Scraping Engine  
3. Content Analysis System
4. API Backend
5. Frontend Application
6. Infrastructure & Deployment

## Quick Start
1. Copy `.env.template` to `.env` and configure
2. Run `docker-compose up -d`
3. Access application at `http://localhost:3000`

## Documentation
See `/docs` directory for detailed specifications and session handoffs.

## 3. LLM Session Coordination System

### Session Handoff Template
Create this template in `docs/SESSION_HANDOFFS/TEMPLATE.md`:

```markdown
# Session [NUMBER] - [COMPONENT_NAME]

## Session Objectives
- [ ] Primary goals
- [ ] Secondary goals
- [ ] Integration requirements

## What I Built
### Files Created/Modified
- List all files with brief descriptions

### Key Components
- Main classes/functions created
- Important configuration changes
- Database schema additions

### API Endpoints (if applicable)
- Endpoint routes and methods
- Request/response schemas
- Authentication requirements

## Integration Points
### Dependencies
- What this component requires from other components
- Environment variables needed
- External services required

### Provides
- What this component offers to other components
- API interfaces exposed
- Data formats produced

## Next Session Requirements
### Prerequisites
- What must be completed before next session
- Configuration that needs to be done
- Test data that should be available

### Handoff Information
- Critical implementation details
- Design decisions made
- Known limitations or todos

## Testing
### Test Files Created
- Unit test files
- Integration test scenarios
- Mock data files

### How to Test
- Commands to run tests
- Expected outcomes
- Known failing tests (with reasons)

## Configuration Changes
### Environment Variables Added
- New variables and their purposes
- Default values
- Security considerations

### Docker/Infrastructure Changes
- Container modifications
- Volume mounts added
- Port configurations

## Notes for Future Sessions
- Important implementation details
- Gotchas or tricky parts
- Suggested improvements
```

## 4. Immediate Action Items

### Create These Files First:
1. **Copy the directory structure** exactly as shown
2. **Create README.md** with the content above
3. **Create .env.template** with all necessary variables
4. **Create basic docker-compose.yml**
5. **Initialize git repository**: `git init && git add . && git commit -m "Initial foundation setup"`

### Set Up Documentation Framework:
1. **Create PROJECT_SPEC.md** with detailed requirements
2. **Create API_SPEC.md** with endpoint specifications  
3. **Create DATABASE_SCHEMA.md** with table definitions
4. **Create session handoff templates** for each planned session

### Establish Development Workflow:
1. **Create branch strategy**: main, develop, session-specific branches
2. **Set up .gitignore** for Python, Node.js, and Docker
3. **Create basic requirements.txt** and package.json templates
4. **Test Docker setup** to ensure containers can start

## 5. First LLM Session Preparation

When you're ready for your first LLM session:

### Start with Session 1 (Database & Models):
```
"I'm working on an EULA comparison platform. Here's my foundation structure: [paste relevant docs]. 

I need you to implement Session 1: Database & Models. Please:
1. Create the PostgreSQL database schema
2. Build SQLAlchemy/Django models
3. Set up database connections
4. Create basic CRUD operations
5. Fill out the session handoff document

Refer to docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md for requirements."
```

This foundation provides everything subsequent LLM sessions need to continue your project seamlessly.# tosboss
